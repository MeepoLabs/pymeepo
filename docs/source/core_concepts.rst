Core Concepts
=============

This section covers the core concepts and components of pymeepo.

Agents
------

Agents are the fundamental building blocks in pymeepo. Each agent:

- Has a specific role and purpose
- Can communicate with other agents
- Can use tools and external resources
- Maintains its own conversation history

Provider Interface
----------------

The provider interface abstracts different LLM providers:

- Unified API across providers
- Consistent response format
- Easy provider switching
- Custom provider support

Agent Teams
----------

Teams enable hierarchical agent structures:

- Supervisor-worker relationships
- Task delegation
- Collaborative problem solving
- Resource sharing

Memory Systems
-------------

Memory management in pymeepo:

- Conversation history
- Shared knowledge bases
- Custom memory backends
- State persistence

Tool System
----------

The tool system enables agents to:

- Use built-in tools
- Create custom tools
- Share tools between agents
- Access external resources

Async Support
------------

Asynchronous operations in pymeepo:

- Native async/await support
- Concurrent agent execution
- Efficient resource usage
- Synchronous wrappers
